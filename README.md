# Portfolio Optimization & Risk Analysis (Python)

This project explores portfolio optimization techniques using Python, focusing on
risk-return tradeoffs, diversification benefits, and downside risk metrics.

## Project Overview
- Constructed and optimized a multi-asset portfolio
- Applied Mean-Variance Optimization (Markowitz)
- Maximized Sharpe Ratio under constraints
- Used Monte Carlo simulation to analyze portfolio risk
- Computed Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR)

## Methods & Concepts
- Expected returns & covariance matrix
- Efficient frontier
- Sharpe Ratio maximization
- Monte Carlo simulations
- VaR & CVaR risk metrics

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## Files
- `Project1.ipynb`: Main analysis notebook

## Key Takeaway
This project demonstrates how quantitative methods can be used to make
data-driven investment decisions and manage portfolio risk effectively.
